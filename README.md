# Next.js Link Component Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js Link component: unexpected routing failures.  The issue occurs even with seemingly correctly configured links. 

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains a simple Next.js component that uses the `Link` component to navigate between pages. Despite correctly configured paths, clicking the links results in a blank page or a 404 error. This indicates a client-side routing problem, which might stem from incorrect configuration or unexpected behavior of the `Link` component. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to the routing problem. This solution is tailored to address potential issues such as incorrect path specification, missing pages, or problems with Next.js's routing mechanism.  The solution might involve verifying page existence, adjusting base paths, or troubleshooting Next.js's configuration.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the issue in `bug.js` and the corrected behavior in `bugSolution.js`
